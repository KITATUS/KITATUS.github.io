{: .notice--success}

This page is a collection of some of the common terminology you'll find in the game development industry. It is written to act as a dictionary to help give detailed definitions to words and phrases you might hear in your day to day adventures in the industry.

## Dictionary
### A

AA (Double A)
: An unofficial name given to studios, publishers or developers that are larger than the Indie offerings but don't quite fit the criteria for AAA. 

: <em>Example: PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds and Fall Guys are seen by most to be AA.</em>
{: .grey .bold}

AAA (Triple A)
: Triple A is term given to games, game studios or publishers who release games that require large budgets (and usually large marketing budgets) to create and release.

: <em>Example: Halo Infinite and Call of Duty are classed as AAA, Inscryption and Super Meat Boy are not.</em>
{: .grey .bold}

Abandonware
: Games that are no longer sold or supported by whomever owns the rights to the title. It is a common misconception that Abandonware titles are in the Public Domain or are Copyright Free - this is incorrect in most cases but usually it does not make financial sense for a company to chase copyright infringement of Abandonware titles due to to their lack of commerical value.

: <em>Example: The Oregon Trail (1971) is classed as Abandonware. </em>
{: .grey .bold}

Artifical Intelligence (A.I)
: A.I in video-games means the fake brain the computer uses to make non playable characters act and react to certain conditions in video-games. This can be something as simple as a character that moves to a location (pathfinding) to a highly reactive enemy character that can anticipate the player's next move and act accordingly.

Pathfinding
: This is the name given to a system that allows an AI controlled character or object to find a path to a location within the game world.
