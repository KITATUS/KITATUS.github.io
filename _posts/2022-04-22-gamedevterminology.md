This page is a collection of some of the common terminology you'll find in the game development industry. It is written to act as a dictionary to help give detailed definitions to words and phrases you might hear in your day to day adventures in the industry.

## Dictionary
### A

AA (Double A)
: An unofficial name given to studios, publishers or developers that are larger than the Indie offerings but don't quite fit the criteria for AAA. 

: <b><em>Example: PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds and Fall Guys are seen by most to be AA.</em></b>

AAA (Triple A)
: Triple A is term given to games, game studios or publishers who release games that require large budgets (and usually large marketing budgets) to create and release.

: <b><em>Example: Halo Infinite and Call of Duty are classed as AAA, Inscryption and Super Meat Boy are not.</em></b>

Abandonware
: Games that are no longer sold or supported by whomever owns the rights to the title. It is a common misconception that Abandonware titles are in the Public Domain or are Copyright Free - this is incorrect in most cases but usually it does not make financial sense for a company to chase copyright infringement of Abandonware titles due to to their lack of commerical value.

: <b><em>Example: The Oregon Trail (1971) is classed as Abandonware. </em></b>

Action Game
: A genre of video games that emphasizes fast-paced, physical challenges, often involving combat, platforming, or other forms of reflex-based gameplay. Action games require quick reflexes, precise timing, and skillful execution of moves or attacks. They often feature linear or semi-linear level design, with a focus on combat encounters and set-piece moments.

: <b><em>Example: Devil May Cry, Bayonetta, God of War, and Ninja Gaiden are classed as action games. </em></b>

Adventure Game
: A genre of video games that typically focuses on exploration, puzzle-solving, and narrative-driven gameplay. Adventure games often have a slower pace compared to action games, with a greater emphasis on storytelling, characters, and world-building. Historically Adventure games featured point-and-click mechanics, where the player interacts with objects and characters in the game world to progress the story. These days, however, Adventure games tend to involve more open-ended exploration of a game world, with puzzles and challenges scattered throughout.

: <b><em>Example: Myst, Monkey Island, Life Is Strange and Firewatch are classed as Adventure games. </em></b>

Artifical Intelligence (A.I)
