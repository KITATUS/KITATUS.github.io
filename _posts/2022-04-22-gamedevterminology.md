**Note:** This page will be constantly updated over time with more and more terminology.
{: .notice--success}

This page is a collection of some of the common terminology you'll find in the game development industry. It is written to act as a dictionary to help give detailed definitions to words and phrases you might hear in your day to day adventures in the industry.

## Dictionary
### A

AA (Double A)
: An unofficial name given to studios, publishers or developers that are larger than the Indie offerings but don't quite fit the criteria for AAA. 

: <b><em>Example: PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds and Fall Guys are seen by most to be AA.</em></b>

AAA (Triple A)
: Triple A is term given to games, game studios or publishers who release games that require large budgets (and usually large marketing budgets) to create and release.

: <b><em>Example: Halo Infinite and Call of Duty are classed as AAA, Inscryption and Super Meat Boy are not.</em></b>

Abandonware
: Games that are no longer sold or supported by whomever owns the rights to the title. It is a common misconception that Abandonware titles are in the Public Domain or are Copyright Free - this is incorrect in most cases but usually it does not make financial sense for a company to chase copyright infringement of Abandonware titles due to to their lack of commerical value.

: <b><em>Example: The Oregon Trail (1971) is classed as Abandonware. </em></b>

Artifical Intelligence (A.I)
: A.I in video-games means the fake brain the computer uses to make non playable characters act and react to certain conditions in video-games. This can be something as simple as a character that moves to a location (pathfinding) to a highly reactive enemy character that can anticipate the player's next move and act accordingly.

### B

### C

### D

Denial Of Service Attack (DoS)
: A malicious attempt to slow down or terminate connections of servers by flooding the target with requests and/or junk data.

Distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS)
: Similar to Denial of Service, Distributed Denial of Service attacks are a DoS attack using multiple endpoints to send the requests and/or junk data.

### E

### F

Free To Play (F2P)
: A game that does not require an upfront payment to play. 
: <b><em>Example: Fortnite and Genshin Impact are popular Free to Play games </em></b>

File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
: An internet protocol used for transfering files between computers. Sometimes used as slang for "Send me this file directly".
: <b><em>Example: "Can you FTP me the previous build?" </em></b>


### G

### H

### I

Indie
: This has changed in meaning from the past; it used to mean indepedent but now means a game developer (or studio) that creates games with either no publisher or a small-mid sized publisher.

: <b><em>Example: Stardew Valley and Celeste are classed as Indie, Horizon Forbidden West and Elden Ring are not. </em></b>

### J
Jira
: A popular project management tool usually used for sprints and issue tracking. Studios that use Jira usually also use Confluence. This term is sometimes confused with "Projet management tool" due to its overwhelming use in studios across the industry.

### K

Kill-Death Ratio (KD) / Kill-Death-Assists (KDA)
: A number generated from kills divided by deaths, usually used in shooter games. In some titles, such as League of Legends and Halo Infinite, assists (helping another player kill someone without firing the killing blow yourself) are also counted (KDA). Note that some games count how much an assist is worth differently (Halo Infinite counts an assist as 0.333 when a kill is worth 1).
: <b><em>Example for KD: 10 kills and 5 deaths is a 2.0 KD [Kills / Deaths]</em></b>
: <b><em>Example for KDA: 10 kills, 5 deaths and 5 Assists is a 3.0 KDA  [(Kills + Assists) / Deaths]</em></b>

### L

Level Of Detail (LOD)
: This is the system where the further an object is from the camera, the less detail is rendered. The closer an object is, the more detail is rendered on the object.

### M

Mixed Reality (MR)
: A combination of Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality with the aim of offering experiences that use interactions in both the physical and virtual worlds.
: A term used when describing both Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality in the same context.

### N

### O

### P

Pay To Win (P2W)
: A game that does not require an upfront payment to play but there are items you can purchase that make you better than other players (and make it easier for you to win). 
: <b><em>Example: APB Reloaded was considered to be a Pay-To-Win Game </em></b>

Pathfinding
: This is the name given to a system that allows an AI controlled character or object to find a path to a location within the game world. Normally, a starting point and destination are fed into pathfinding systems and other variables are then layered on top to find the clearest logical path for the AI controlled entity to take.

Physically Based Rendering (PBR)
: A rendering method that aims to render realistic game worlds by using realistic lighting and surface models.

Playtest
: Usually an internal event where some (or all) of the team play a build of the game to check for quality, bugs, test a new feature or to get a "feel" for how the game is currently playing.

### Q
Quality Assurance (QA)
: A part of a game development team that regularly checks builds for bugs and problems.

### R
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
: RDP is a protocol for dialing into a computer and controlling it remotely. The term is generally used loosely for anytime you remote into a machine (such as with Parsec, Chrome Remote Desktop, Remote Desktop Connection) .etc
: <b><em>Example: "I'm working from home today so I'll RDP for the playtest" </em></b>

: A term given to the collection of menus and visual components that allow the user to interact with the game.
