## What Are KxF Micro-Games?
KxF are smaller projects than a full-blown release. Released as pay-what-you-want, these games are meant to try unique ideas without having to stretch the ideas out to fit a full 60 hours experience. But donâ€™t let that fool you - these are not just mini-games in the conventional sense; these are full end-to-end playable experiences! A full video-game on a smaller scale! 

## Why?
KxF Micro-Games allows us to try unique ideas and build memorable experiences without having to go through the motions of a full video game release. We can remain a small team for these releases and instead of having to tack on various systems to pad out a game, we can give you the pure essence of something unique and fun minus the fluff!

This benefits us and the players; we get to build unique things and try new ideas and players can have a lean well-prepared meal without having to invest 60+ hours in an experience!

## Who are KxF Micro-Games For?
Everyone! KxF Micro-Games is built as a game experience to be enjoyed by everyone from a casual video-game player to fellow game developers in the trenches who are looking for fresh experiences!

## How Does It Work?
Normally in the game development cycle, games reach a First Playable / Vertical Slice phase. These are usually snippets of games that encapsulate the full experience  - usually a level or two of the full experience. These Vertical Slices are usually well polished (as if they were a snippet of the eventual final game) to get a sense of the project direction / validity / funding .etc.

The KxF Micro-Games series stop development at this point of the game development cycle and the Vertical Slices are released to you, the players, as a polished experience for you to play!

These are not random mini-games slapped together but a full video-game; smaller in scope and focusing heavily on the unique features of the game.

## ...So They're Mini-Games?
Nope! KxF Micro-Games are fully-fledged video games, just on a smaller scale!

## How Many Micro-Games Are Planned?
At this point in time, there is no definitive number of Micro-Games planned. There could be 5 more, 500 or 5,000. The goal of this project is not to limit ourselves to hard numbers but to experiment with fresh ideas and work on interesting snippets of ideas.

### How Often With They Release?
KxF Micro-Games are focused on quality and the experience above everything else. Because of this, there is no specific release schedule for upcoming KxF Micro-Games. Please check back for more information on future releases or follow us on social media. Your passion means a lot to us but we would rather focus on making the best experiences we can for you rather than meeting arbitrary deadlines.

## What If I Really Like A Game?
We really hope you do enjoy the KxF Micro-Games series! If there is one game in particular that you really enjoy and you would love to see more of - let us know! 

Also, be sure to let your friends and nearest / favourite publisher know (but please do not harass people!). 

If enough people make enough noise, particular projects may receive funding and publisher support to give the projects the tender, love and care they need to thrive as a full experience.

## How Can I Support KxF Micro-Games?
There are many ways to support the KxF Micro-Games series. Just playing the games is a great start! Offering feedback can help inform future KxF Micro-Games so feel free to give your thoughts on our releases!

If you would like to take things a step further; you can send our games to your friends and family to help spread awareness.

For those who want to take it either further; you can pay-what-you-want for any of the games in KxF Micro-Games Series or you can donate to KITATUS and Friends directly via Ko-Fi: [KxF Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/J3J1AMEFO)

Support at any level is greatly appreciated and it all goes to make the KxF Micro-Games Series (and KITATUS and Friends as a whole!) the best they can possibly be!

## Will These Games Be Released As A Compilation On Console / A Different Platform?
At this moment in time, the focus is on the KxF Micro-Games Series itself. Who knows where these games might end up in the future? There are no current plans to port these experiences anywhere else but watch this space!

## Will You Make Full Games In The Future?
Never say never! Whilst the plans for the immediate future are to work on Micro-Games, you never know what the future will bring. Stay tuned for updates!

## Will Some KxF Micro-games Be Sequels / Continuations Of Previous Releases?
There are no current plans to create sequel Micro-Game Experiences, to tie the experiences together into a shared universe or anything else along those lines. The key focus at this moment in time is strictly to create fun and unique experiences. Whilst the answer is not a definitive no, we do not have plans at this time to do Sequel / Continuation Micro-Games.
